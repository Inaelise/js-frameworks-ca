![image](/public/images/variety-screenshot.png)

## Description

This is my assignment for the JavaScript Frameworks course. It is an eCom store that I named "Variety".

All API functionality is managed by an existing application. The API used in the project is the Online Store endpoint in the Noroff API.

We were required to build these pages:

1. Home page
2. Individual product page.
3. Checkout/cart page.
4. Checkout success page.
5. Contact page.

Required functionality:

- Display list of products.
- Look-ahead search bar.
- Clicking on a product takes the user to an individual product page.
- Cart icon in header that displays number of products in the cart.
- Display data for a single product on the individual product page.
- Adding products to the cart by clicking an "Add to cart" button.
- Clear cart when user reaches the checkout success page.
- Contact form with form validation that logs the data to the console.
- Switch between pages with React Router and use dynamic segment for the individual product page.

We were allowed to use a CSS Framework but were encouraged to design from scratch use either styled-components or CSS Modules. I chose CSS Modules.
